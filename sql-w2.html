  <h2>1. Further data retrieval</h2>
  <p>
    In section 4 of the first lesson we used the <code>SELECT</code> statement
    to retrieve information from the database. However, this just retrieved all
    of the records from the desired column(s). We might want more specific
    information from only certain parts and records of the database. There are
    many different ways we can get different bits of information from a database.
    Some of those are detailed here.
