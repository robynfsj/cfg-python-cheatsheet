# Coding Cheatsheet
This contains all of my notes from the Code First Girls courses I have undertaken. I have written them up as a website in order to practice the skills I learnt on the first CFG course I attended.

 The courses covered in these notes include:
 * Introduction to Web Development 
 * Introduction to Python Programming
 * Introduction to Data Science and SQL Programming
