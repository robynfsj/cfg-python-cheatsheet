  <h2>1. Introduction to big data, databases and SQL programming</h2>

  <h3>1.1 What is big data?</h3>
  <p>
    Big data is a huge volume of structured or unstructured information. It is
    usually a collection of information that is so large that it is difficult
    to just search through, analyse or store without the use of some
    programming. Data is captured and entered into a database where it is
    stored. The data in the database can then be analysed. A database is often
    represented by the image of a cylindrical container:
  </p>
  <i class="fas fa-database fa-10x"></i>
  <p>
    This course focuses on the database and storage aspects of data science.
    The database is where the data is stored and we are learning to access and
    process the data using the <strong>SQL</strong> (Structured Query Language)
    programming language. SQL can be reffered to as either the individual
    letters (so would be spoken as <emphasis>ess queue elle</emphasis>) or
    as a word (sounding like the word <empasis>sequel</emphasis>).
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 How is big data used in tech?</h3>
  <p>
    Big data is often used in <strong>software engineering</strong> and in
    <strong>data analysis</strong>.
  </p>
  <h4>Software engineering</h4>
  <p>
    In software engineering, the database supports the back end, which in turn
    supports the front end:
  </p>
  <img src="images/layers_model.png" alt="diagram of front end, back end and
  database with arrows going both ways between each">
  <h4>Data science</h4>
  <p>
    In data science, SQL and databases are used only in certain steps of the
    process. In the 6 step process illustrated below, SQL is used mainly in
    steps 2, 3 and 4.

  <h3>1.3 Job roles that use SQL</h3>
  <p>
    There are numerous different job roles that would benefit from knowledge of
    SQL and databases. A few of these are listed in the image below:
  </p>
  <img src="images/job_roles.png" alt="image of various job roles that use SQL
  programming and database knowledge">
  <p>
    The first homework task of this week is to go through this list and identify
    the job role closest to where I would like to be and then write a paragraph
    about my desired job role and how I would like to use my data, SQL and DB
    skills. The following is the paragraph I have written for this task:

  <h2>2. What are databases and SQL?</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Databases</h3>
  <p>
    As detailed in section 1.1, databases are a virtual container where data is
    stored and is often represented by the cylindrical storage container symbol.
    A database contains lots of tables, which can relate to each other.
  </p>
  <img src="images/db_structure.png" alt="image showing the structure of a
  database, which is lots of tables that are linked together">

  <h3>2.2 SQL</h3>
  <p>
    As detailed in section 1.1, SQL is the programming language that is used to
    access the information stored in the database. You can choose to extract
    only the parts of the database that you are interested in:
  </p>
  <img src="images/sql_diagram.png" alt="image showing how SQL is used to query
  a database">

  <h3>2.3 The Relational Database Model (RDBM)</h3>
  <p>
    The RDBM is a type of management system for databases. A relational
    database is just a type of database where data in one part of the database
    matches with data in another part of the database. It is usually organised
    in tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    As would be expected, each table consists of columns and rows. The rows are
    called <strong>records</strong> and each column is given a data type (e.g.
    integer, character&#8212;see the following section).
  </p>




  <h2>3. Different types of data</h2>
  <p>
    Different data types can be used in SQL. You are required to declare the
    type of data that a column will contain in a SQL table. The following table
    details some of the different types of data that you can work with in SQL.
    For a more comprehensive list, see the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp">
    w3schools website</a>.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Data type</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CHAR(size)</code></td>
      <td>
        These are strings of a fixed length. The length of the string is typed
        as an integer in the brackets where it says size, up to a maximum of 255
        characters. (Recap&#8212;strings are mixed characters as they are typed
        and can contain any combinations of numbers, letters and specical
        characters, so long as they are supported by the language in use.) E.g.
        <code>CHAR(50)</code> would be a string with 50 characters. If any other
        number of characters is entered, it will return an error.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>VARCHAR(size)</code></td>
      <td>
        This is the same as the previous data type except a string of any length
        will be accepted, up to a maximum of the number of characters specified
        in the brackets.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>BINARY(size)</code></td>
      <td>
        This is the same as CHAR(size) so is fixed length. But rather than
        taking any characters, it will only accept binary byte strings (so zeros
        and ones). Here the <emphasis>size</emphasis> in brackets specifies the
        number of bytes an entry must contain. Each binary digit is a bit and 8
        bits make one byte.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FLOAT(p)</code></td>
      <td>
        We encountered floats in Python. These are floating point numbers, which
        are decimal numbers. The concept is a bit more complex than that but for
        now just think of these as decimal numbers where <emphasis>p</emphasis>
        is the amount of precision (or number of decimal places) required.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>INTEGER</code></td>
      <td>
        These are for whole numbers and can also be shortened to <code>INT</code>.
        You can also add a size in brackets if you want a fixed number of digits.
        This can be shortened to <code>INT</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DECIMAL(m, d)</code></td>
      <td>
        This is used for decimal numbers where the decimal point is fixed in
        place (unlike floats where is can be moved). <emphasis>m</emphasis>
        specifies the number of digits before the decimal point and <emphasis>d
        </emphasis> specifies the number of digits after the decimal point.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>BOOLEAN</code></td>
      <td>
        This is used where values can be true or false. A value of 0 is used for
        false and 1 is used for true. The shortened form <code>BOOL</code> also
        works.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DATE</code></td>
      <td>
        This is for a date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>TIME</code></td>
      <td>
        This is used for time in the format: hh:mm:ss.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>TIMESTAMP</code></td>
      <td>
        This is for both the time and date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>




  <h2>4. SQL syntax&#8212;coding queries</h2>
  <h3>4.1 Basic queries</h3>
  <p>
    In order to get information (i.e. data) out of a database, we need to ask
    it questions. This is called <strong>querying</strong>. These queries are
    written in the programming language SQL. The syntax for a basic SQL query
    asking for one column to be returned from a table is shown here:
  </p>
  <img src="images/sql_query.png" alt="image of an SQL query">
  <p>
    Here the keyword <strong>SELECT</strong> is used. Although SQL keywords are
    not case sensitive, it is convention to write them in upper-case (e.g.
    SELECT rather than select). This <strong>SELECT</strong> statement is often
    followed by a list of columns (as their column names) that are to be
    retrieved. A comma is placed between each column name (no comma is added
    after the last column name). This is then followed by a <strong>FROM</strong>
    statement, which specifies the name of the table that contains the columns
    you have asked for.
  </p>
  <p>Here is an example of this query in action:</p>
  <code>
    SELECT<br>
    column1,<br>
    column2<br>
    FROM<br>
    table1;
  </code>

  <h3>4.2 Qualify the column name with a table name</h3>
  <p>
    When we write more complicated queries than the ones shown so far, we need
    to keep track of which tables each column comes from. It can get especially
    confusing if you are trying to get data from two different tables that each
    have a column with the same name (e.g. a column called column1 existing in
    both table1 and table2&#8212;you need to be able to specify which table you
    are taking column1 from). It is good practice to always specify the table,
    even if you are only using one table. To do this, the following syntax is
    used:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT<br>
    table1.column1,<br>
    table1.column2<br>
    FROM<br>
    table1;
  </code>


  <h3>4.3 Using aliases</h3>
  <p>
    In SQL, an alias is a temporary name you give to a table or column for a
    particular query. It doesn't overide the actual name of the table or column
    and only exists within the specific query that you assign it. They are used
    to reduce the amount of typing required.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the following example, several aliases are used. <strong>table1</strong>
    has the alias <strong>t1</strong> and the columns are given the aliases
    <strong>c1</strong> and <strong>c2</strong>.
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT<br>
    t1.column1 AS c1,<br>
    t1.column2 AS c2<br>
    FROM<br>
    table1 AS t1;
  </code>

  <h3>4.4 The wildcard</h3>
  <p>
    The wildcard (<strong>*</strong>) is used to select all the columns in a
    table. It is considered bad practice to use it so it should only be used
    when exploring data. The full syntax should be written in an query you want
    to save for future use. The following shows how you would use it in a query:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT *<br>
    FROM table1
  </code>




  <h2>5. SQL syntax&#8212;building a database</h2>

  <h3>5.1 Creating a database</h3>
  <p>
    Although you can create databases with SQL itself, it isn't something that
    is done very often. To create a database and give it a name you would use
    the following syntax:
  </p>
  <code>CREATE DATABASE database_name;</code>
  <p>
    Before you can do anything with any database, whether you want to add more
    data to the database or query a database, you need to specify which database
    you are wanting to use. This is done with the following syntax:
  </p>
  <code>USE database_name;</code>

  <h3>5.2 Creating tables</h3>
  <p>
    To create a table, you must give the table a name and declare the names and
    data types of each column in the table. The column details are put inside
    brackets and each column is separated with a comma. The following syntax is
    used to create a table:
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE table_name<br>
    (column1 DATATYPE,<br>
    column2 DATATYPE,<br>
    column3 DATATYPE);
  </code>

  <h3>5.3 Null values</h3>
  <p>
    No entry in a table can be just left blank (this is the same as my experience
    of R). If there is no data for a particular cell, it will be classified as
    <code>NULL</code>. When you create a table, you can tell it whether to
    accept null values for a particular column or not. This information is added
    after the data type. In the following example, <emphasis>column1</emphasis>
    is set to not accept null values while the other two columns will accept a
    null value. If you later add records to this table and don't provide an
    entry for the first column, an error would be returned.
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE table_name<br>
    (column1 DATATYPE NOT NULL,<br>
    column2 DATATYPE,<br>
    column3 DATATYPE);
  </code>

  <h3>5.4 Populating tables</h3>
  <p>
    Once a table has been created using the above method, we can then start
    adding entries into the table. You first have to specify which table you are
    adding the entries to, then type out the column names of that table in
    brackets, before adding the new values. Each record (row) is put in their
    own brackets. Values in a record (i.e. the entry for each column for one row)
    are separated by commas. The records (rows) are also separated by a comma.
    The following code adds three records to a table that contains three columns.
  </p>
  <code>
    INSERT INTO table_name<br>
    (column1, column2, column3)<br>
    VALUES<br>
    (value1, value2, value3),<br>
    (value1, value2, value3),<br>
    (value1, value2, value3),<br>
    (value1, value2, value3);<br>
  </code>

  <h3>5.5 Worked example</h3>
  <p>
    This might be a bit clearer to see with a worked example. The following code
    is what I wrote in the lesson and creates then populates a table. Note that
    the two dashes (<code>--</code>) can be used to write comments.
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE DATABASE bakery;<br>
    USE DATABASE bakery;<br>
    <br>
    -- Create  table to contain details of the sweet products.<br>
    CREATE TABLE sweet(<br>
    id INT NOT NULL,<br>
    item_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,<br>
    price FLOAT(2) NOT NULL<br>
    );<br>
    <br>
    -- Populate the sweet table.<br>
    INSERT INTO sweet<br>
    (id, item_name, price)<br>
    VALUES<br>
    (1, 'doughnut', 0.5),<br>
    (2, 'croissant', 0.75),<br>
    (3, 'painauchocolat', 0.55),<br>
    (4, 'cinnamon swirl', 0.45),<br>
    (5, 'cannoli', 0.88),<br>
    (6, 'apple tart', 1.12);<br>
    <br>
    -- Create a table for the savoury products.<br>
    CREATE TABLE savoury(<br>
    id INT NOT NULL,<br>
    item_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,<br>
    price FLOAT(2),<br>
    main_ingredient VARCHAR(50)<br>
    );<br>
    <br>
    -- Populate the savoury table.<br>
    INSERT INTO savoury<br>
    (id, item_name, price, main_ingredient)<br>
    VALUES<br>
    (1, 'meat pie', 1.25, 'pork'),<br>
    (2, 'sausage roll', 1, null),<br>
    (3, 'pasty', 2.45, 'beef');<br>
    <br>
    -- Quickly check the tables have been created correctly.<br>
    SELECT * FROM sweet;<br>
    SELECT * FROM savoury;
    </code>
