  <h2>1. Views</h2>
  <h3>1.1 Introduction and creating views</h3>
  <p>
    Views are tables created with a SQL statement that are stored in a database
    for quick and easy data retrieval at a later date. You would use one if
    there was a particular query you find you run frequently in order to save
    time and effort. A <code>SELECT</code> statement is used to create the table
    and it is then stored in the database as an <strong>object</strong>.
    <strong>Nested views</strong> can also be created whereby a view is created
    based on another view rather than on an original table.
  </p>
    Views do not actually store any data themselves so can be though of as a
    virtual snapshot. They are often referred to as <strong>virtual tables
    </strong> and the original tables from which the data is retrieved are
    called <strong>base tables</strong>. A user accessing a view does not
    automatically get access to the rest of the database and the base tables.
    This makes them useful if there are certain columns of a database you want
    to hide from the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code to create a view is as follows:
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT col1, col2, col3<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM table_name;
  </code>
  <p>
    Here is an example we produced in the lesson:
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE VIEW vw_sales_staff AS<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT SalesPerson, SalesAmount<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM sales1;
  </code>
  <p>
    Although we didn't cover this in class, an example in the <em>Learning
    SQL</em> book (Beaulieu, 2020) shows that you can assign names to the
    columns in the view:
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE VIEW customer_vw<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(customer_id,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_name,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_name,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;email<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)<br>
    AS<br>
    SELECT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customer_id<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_name<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_name<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concat(substr(email,1,2), '*****', substr(email, -4)) email<br>
    FROM customer;
  </code>
  <p>
    In the above example, the column names for the view are given in brackets
    after the <code>CREATE VIEW</code> statement. The <code>SELECT</code>
    statement then fetches the relevant information from the <strong>customer
    </strong> table. Note here than the middle parts of the email address have
    been redacted from the view. This sort of thing is done for security
    purposes and is an example of using a view to protect sensitive information
    from being distributed. An email address in this column would appear as
    "<code>ro*****.com</code>".
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Updating views</h2>
    <p>
      Once a view is created, it can be treated as a table. Data can be modified
      and new records can be inserted into it using <code>UPDATE</code> or
      <code>INSERT</code> statements. Updating a view in this way directly
      modifies the underlying database and not just the view. This is useful if
      someone has been given a view without access to the underlying database
      but wants to add new records to the database. Their new records will
      officially enter the actual database (and not just the view) without
      having to give them full access to a database full of potentially
      sensitive information. There are numerous restrictions, however, on the
      types of statements you can use to modify a view. A view can't be updated
      if it contains any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aggregate functions (SUM(),MIN(),MAX(), and others)</li>
      <li><code>DISTINCT</code></li>
      <li><code>GROUP BY</code></li>
      <li><code>HAVING</code></li>
      <li><code>UNION</code> or <code>UNION ALL</code></li>
      <li>Subquery in the select list</li>
      <li>Certain types of joins</li>
      <li>Non updatable view in the FROM clause (applied restriction)</li>
      <li>A subquery in the <code>WHERE</code> clause that refers to a table in
        the <code>FROM</code> clause</li>
      <li>Refers only to literal values (literal strings are enclosed in single
        or double quotation marks)</li>
      <li>Multiple references to any column of a base table</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a simple view is updateable, it is possible for someone to update the
      data in the base tables that is not actually a part of the view or to
      update the data so that something that was in the view is no longer part
      of the view. An update like this makes the view inconsistent and is not
      desirable. To avoid this type of thing happening, we can use a <code>WITH
      CHECK OPTION</code>. This prevents a user from updating or inserting data
      into the base tables that would not appear in the view. <code>WITH CHECK
      OPTION</code> is added to the end of the <code>CREATE VIEW</code> code.
      Here is an example from the lesson:
    </p>
    <code>
      CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_staff_common2 AS<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employeeID,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstName,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lastName,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobTitle,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;managerID,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;department<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staff<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobTitle LIKE '%DB%'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITH CHECK OPTION;
    </code>
    <p>
      In this example, if we try to add a new employee that would not appear in
      the view (i.e. an employee with a job title that does not contain the
      letters "DB"), then an error is returned and the record is not added. If
      the employee matches the desired criteria then the record is added to the
      database and the view is updated so that the new record also appears in
      the view.
    </p>


  <h2>2. Stored programs</h2>
  <p>There are four types of stored programs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stored functions</li>
    <li>Stored procedures</li>
    <li>Triggers</li>
    <li>Events</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.1 Stored functions and procedures (stored routines)</h3>
  <h4>Stored functions</h4>
  <p>
    Stored functions and procedures contain written code that is saved in order
    for it to be used over and over again without having to type it out each
    time. They are stored as objects in the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stored functions, sometimes referred to as User Defined Functions (UDF) to
    avoid confusion with the built-in functions, contain SQL statements that
    return a single value. They are run in a similar way to the built-in
    functions. They can be used inside <code>SELECT</code> statements to return
    a single value. They can't modify or change anything in the database so can't
    execute <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code>
    statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code to create a stored function is shown below. A key feature of this
    code is that a delimiter is set. This is so that there is a distinction
    between the end of statements within the function to be stored (for which
    the usual ; symbol can still be used) and the end of the actual statement
    that is creating the function (for which // is used). A function name must
    also be declared. This can't be the same as any of the built-in functions.
    Function parameters are also declared along with their data types. These can
    be thought of as the input arugments you are using when you call the
    function. You then have to declare the start and end of the function with a
    <code>BEGIN</code> keyword and an <code>END</code> keyword. The SQL queries
    that make up the function can be of any level of complexity and can include
    joins, filters and other elements.
  </p>
  <code>
      DELIMITER//<br>
      CREATE FUNCTION function_name(function_parameter1 DATA TYPE)<br>
      RETURNS DATA TYPE<br>
      <br>
      BEGIN<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function body;<br>
      <br>
      RETURN expression;<br>
      END//
  </code>
  <p>
    It can be a bit more difficult than you first think to write a function.
    Although the one we went through in class was easy to read through and to
    see how it worked, I found it a lot more difficult writing a function from
    scratch myself for homework. The following is the function I wrote for the
    homework. I decided to use a database table containing the total sales
    amounts for each sales person. I decided they would each get 2% commission
    and would create a stored function to calculate this. My experience on the
    Python course definitely came in useful for understanding how functions work
    in SQL!
  </p>
  <code>
    DELIMITER //<br>
    CREATE FUNCTION commission(input_amount DECIMAL(4,2))<br>
    RETURNS DECIMAL(4,2)<br>
    DETERMINISTIC<br>
    BEGIN<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DECLARE output_amount DECIMAL(4,2);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SET output_amount = 2 / 100 * input_amount;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RETURN output_amount;<br>
    END//<br>
    DELIMITER ;<br>
  </code>
  <p>To call the stored function, I then used  the following code:</p>
  <code>
    SELECT<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SalesPerson,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SalesAmount,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commission(SalesAmount) AS CommissionAmount<br>
    FROM sales1;
  </code>
  <p>And this is what the output looked like:</p>
  <img src="../images/stored-func-out.png" alt="Screenshot of a table showing
  sales people, their total sales amount and their commission amount.">

  <h4>Stored procedures</h4>
  <p>
    Stored procedures contain SQL statements that are used to read and modify
    data. They are typically used for data validation and access control methods.
    Unlike functions (and as demonstrated in the previous example) they can't be
    used inside <code>SELECT</code> statements. However, they can use <code>
    INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code> and <code>SELECT
    </code> statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The syntax used to create a procedure is similar to that used for creating
    a function:
  </p>
  <code>
    DELIMITER //
    CREATE PROCEDURE proc_name()<br>
    BEGIN<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure body;<br>
    <br>
    END//<br>
    DELIMITER ;
  </code>
  <p>
    Calling a prodecure is different to calling a function. You can't include a
    procedure in a <code>SELECT</code> statement. You do it using the following
    syntax:
  </p>
  <code>CALL procedure_name();</code>
  <p>
    Again we read through a procedure in class and had to write one from scratch
    for homework. I decided to write one that would return the names of all of
    the products sold in a bakery. This is how I did it:
  </p>
  <code>
    DELIMITER //<br>
    CREATE PROCEDURE all_products()<br>
    BEGIN<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT sw.item_name FROM sweet AS sw<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNION<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT sa.item_name FROM savoury AS sa<br>
    END//<br>
    DELIMITER ;
  </code>
  <p>I then ran the following to run the procedure:</p>
  <code>CALL all_products()</code>
  <p>This returned these results:</p>
  <img src="../images/stored-proc-out.png" alt="Screenshot of a table containing
  one column called item_name and containing a list of products sold in a
  bakery.">

  <h3>2.2 Triggers</h3>
  <p>
    Triggers are blocks of code that run automatically when a DML operation like
    <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code> is run. The
    execution of a trigger is often referred to as <strong>trigger firing</strong>.
    Triggers can fire before or after the operation is run. The main purpose of
    using a trigger is to maintain data consistency and integrity. For example,
    you could create a trigger that will format the capitalisation of a new
    record so that the capitalisation is consistent for every record in a table
    (this is the example we ran through in class).
  </p>
  <p>
    The following syntax is used to create a trigger. You need to choose if you
    want to use the before or after keyword, which will specify whether the
    trigger fires before or after the event. You then need to specify the
    operation that will fire the trigger (<code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE
    </code> or <code>DELETE</code>). The <code>FOR EACH ROW</code> clause creates
    a row level trigger that fires for each row. <code>NEW</code> and <code>OLD
    </code> keywords can be used in the trigger body to represent the old and
    new values to be inserted/updated/deleted (not shown below).
  </p>
  <code>
    DELIMITER //<br>
    CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name<br>
    BEFORE/AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ON table_or_view_name<br>
    FOR EACH ROW<br>
    BEGIN<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger body;<br>
    <br>
    END//<br>
    DELIMITER ;
  </code>
