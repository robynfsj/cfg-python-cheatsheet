  <h2>1. Further data retrieval</h2>
  <p>
    In section 4 of the first lesson we used the <code>SELECT</code> statement
    to retrieve information from the database. However, this just retrieved all
    of the records from the desired column(s). We might want more specific
    information from only certain parts and records of the database. There are
    many different ways we can get different bits of information from a database.
    Some of those are detailed here.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 Selecting distinct entries</h3>
  <p>
    In order to return non-repeating values in the result columns we use the
    <code>DISTINCT</code> clause. The example used in the lesson was to imagine
    you want to know all of the first names of people in your class. You want to
    know just what the names themselves are, not how many people are called each
    name. The following is a table of first names of the people in a class:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>first_name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sophie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shelly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hannah</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Joanna</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sophie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hannah</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    We can use the <code>DISTINCT</code> operator to return the names above but
    without duplicates. The code to do this is:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT DISTINCT table_alias.column_name<br>
    FROM table_name AS table_alias;
  </code>
  <p>The following shows the code that would be used in our example:</p>
  <code>
    SELECT DISTINCT cp.first_name<br>
    FROM class_participants AS cp;
  </code>
  <p>And this is what the output would be:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>first_name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sophie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shelly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hannah</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Joanna</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    If <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> was run on two columns (e.g. first name and
    last name), then it would return unique <strong>combinations</strong>. So if
    the two different Hannah's had different last names, the first name "Hannah"
    would still appear twice in the results.
  </p>


  <h3>1.2 Selecting entries that meet specific conditions</h3>
  <p>
    We can apply conditions to the results we want to return so that we only
    return records than meet specific criteria. One way of doing this is to use
    the <code>WHERE</code> clause:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT table_alias.column_name<br>
    FROM table_name AS table_alias<br>
    WHERE table_alias.column_name = "condition";
  </code>
  <p>
    We practiced this in class using a database called <strong>PARTS</strong>,
    which contains several tables about different projects, their suppliers and
    the parts that the suppliers are supplying to the different projects. One
    question we were asked was to return all of the projects that are run in
    London. This is what the relevant table looks like and is called <strong>
    project</strong>:
  </p>
  <img src="images/project_table.png" alt="Image of a table with three columns.">
  <p>
    The following is the code that would be needed to select the project names
    (which are under the column <strong>jname</strong>) of only the projects
    that are based in London:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT j.jname<br>
    FROM project AS j<br>
    WHERE j.city = 'London';
  </code>


  <h2>2. Database design and management</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Constraints</h3>
  <p>
    Constraints are rules that can be applied to the columns of a table. They
    are set when you create the table. When you later add information into the
    table, if the data you enter does not meet the requirements of the contraint
    you have added then it will return an error message. In this way, they ensure
    the <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong> of the data
    in the table.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several different types of constraint that we can apply to a
    column in a table. They are documented in the table below.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Constraint</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PRIMARY KEY</code></td>
      <td>
        This is applied to the column that is used to uniquely identify each
        record in a table. There can only be one primary key in a table but it
        can be multiple columns, in which case it is known as a <strong>compound
        key</strong>. The primary key will never change and can be thought of as
        an index.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FOREIGN KEY</code></td>
      <td>
        This restricts the column to contain only the values that are present in
        the primary key of a different table. In this way, a column that is a
        foreign key provides a link to another table (the basis of a
        relational database). There can be multiple foreign keys in a table. The
        values of the column with a foreign key don't have to be unqiue.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>NOT NULL</code></td>
      <td>
        This requires a value to be entered for the column to which this
        constraint is applied.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>UNIQUE</code></td>
      <td>
        A column with this constraint would require a unique value for each
        record in the column. It is like a primary key but there can be more
        than one of these.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CHECK</code></td>
      <td>
        This constraint is used to restrict the value that can be entered in a
        column between a declared range. A check is performed on the entered
        value before it is stored in the database.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DEFAULT</code></td>
      <td>This sets a default value for the column, which will be entered for
      each record unless a value is specified.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Constraints are declared when you create the table (although they can also
    be declared later on too). The code to assign a constraint when creating a
    new table can be done in a couple of ways. In this first example, a
    constraint is declared after the data type:
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE table_name (<br>
    column1, DATA TYPE CONSTRAINT TYPE,<br>
    column2, DATA TYPE CONTRAINT TYPE,<br>
    column3, DATA TYPE CONSTRAINT TYPE);
  </code>
  <p>
    In this second example, a constraint is applied after all of the columns
    have been declared.
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE table_name (<br>
    column1, DATA TYPE,<br>
    column2, DATA TYPE,<br>
    column3, DATA TYPE,<br>
    CONSTRAINT contraint_name CONTRAINT TYPE (column_name)<br>
    );
  </code>
  <p>
    An example of a table we created in class using this code is shown below. In
    this example, the constraint <code>NOT NULL</code> is added in-line to the
    <strong>customer_id</strong> column and the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>
    constraint is added at the end to the same column. The name of the <code>
    PRIMARY KEY</code> constraint is given as <strong>pk_customer_id</strong>.
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE customer (<br>
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>
    first_name VARCHAR(55),<br>
    last_name VARCHAR(55),<br>
    CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)<br>
    );
  </code>

  <h3>2.2 Normalisation</h3>
  <p>
    Database normalisation is a key aspect of creating a relational database. It
    is the process of a designing a database so that each independent piece of
    information only occurs once in the database (except for forgeign keys
    linking the tables). Each table therefore contains data on one specific
    topic only, minimising duplicate data, avoiding data modifcation issues and
    helping to simplify queries.
