  <h2>1. Further data retrieval</h2>
  <p>
    In section 4 of the first lesson we used the <code>SELECT</code> statement
    to retrieve information from the database. However, this just retrieved all
    of the records from the desired column(s). We might want more specific
    information from only certain parts and records of the database. There are
    many different ways we can get different bits of information from a database.
    Some of those are detailed here.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 Selecting distinct entries</h3>
  <p>
    In order to return non-repeating values in the result columns we use the
    <code>DISTINCT</code> clause. The example used in the lesson was to imagine
    you want to know all of the first names of people in your class. You want to
    know just what the names themselves are, not how many people are called each
    name. The following is a table of first names of the people in a class:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>first_name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sophie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shelly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hannah</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Joanna</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sophie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hannah</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    We can use the <code>DISTINCT</code> operator to return the names above but
    without duplicates. The code to do this is:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT DISTINCT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table_alias.column_name<br>
    FROM<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table_name AS table_alias;
  </code>
  <p>The following shows the code that would be used in our example:</p>
  <code>
    SELECT DISTINCT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp.first_name<br>
    FROM<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class_participants AS cp;
  </code>
  <p>And this is what the output would be:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>first_name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sophie</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shelly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hannah</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Joanna</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    If <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> was run on two columns (e.g. first name and
    last name), then it would return unique <strong>combinations</strong>. So if
    the two different Hannah's had different last names, the first name "Hannah"
    would still appear twice in the results.
  </p>


  <h3>1.2 Selecting entries that meet specific conditions</h3>
  <p>
    We can apply conditions to the results we want to return so that we only
    return records than meet specific criteria. One way of doing this is to use
    the <code>WHERE</code> clause:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table_alias.column_name<br>
    FROM<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table_name AS table_alias<br>
    WHERE<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table_alias.column_name = "condition";
  </code>
  <p>
    We practiced this in class using a database called <strong>PARTS</strong>,
    which contains several tables about different projects, their suppliers and
    the parts that the suppliers are supplying to the different projects. One
    question we were asked was to return all of the projects that are run in
    London. This is what the relevant table looks like and is called <strong>
    project</strong>:
  </p>
  <img src="../images/project_table.png" alt="Image of a table with three columns.">
  <p>
    The following is the code that would be needed to select the project names
    (which are under the column <strong>jname</strong>) of only the projects
    that are based in London:
  </p>
  <code>
    SELECT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j.jname<br>
    FROM<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project AS j<br>
    WHERE<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j.city = 'London';
  </code>


  <h2>2. Database design and management</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Constraints</h3>
  <p>
    Constraints are rules that can be applied to the columns of a table. They
    are set when you create the table. When you later add information into the
    table, if the data you enter does not meet the requirements of the contraint
    you have added then it will return an error message. In this way, they ensure
    the <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong> of the data
    in the table.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several different types of constraint that we can apply to a
    column in a table. They are documented in the table below.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Constraint</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PRIMARY KEY</code></td>
      <td>
        This is applied to the column that is used to uniquely identify each
        record in a table. There can only be one primary key in a table but it
        can be multiple columns, in which case it is known as a <strong>compound
        key</strong>. The primary key will never change and can be thought of as
        an index.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FOREIGN KEY</code></td>
      <td>
        This restricts the column to contain only the values that are present in
        the primary key of a different table. In this way, a column that is a
        foreign key provides a link to another table (the basis of a
        relational database). There can be multiple foreign keys in a table. The
        values of the column with a foreign key don't have to be unqiue.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>NOT NULL</code></td>
      <td>
        This requires a value to be entered for the column to which this
        constraint is applied.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>UNIQUE</code></td>
      <td>
        A column with this constraint would require a unique value for each
        record in the column. It is like a primary key but there can be more
        than one of these.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CHECK</code></td>
      <td>
        This constraint is used to restrict the value that can be entered in a
        column between a declared range. A check is performed on the entered
        value before it is stored in the database.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DEFAULT</code></td>
      <td>This sets a default value for the column, which will be entered for
      each record unless a value is specified.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Constraints are declared when you create the table (although they can also
    be declared later on too). The code to assign a constraint when creating a
    new table can be done in a couple of ways. In this first example, a
    constraint is declared after the data type:
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE table_name (<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column1, DATA TYPE CONSTRAINT TYPE,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column2, DATA TYPE CONTRAINT TYPE,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column3, DATA TYPE CONSTRAINT TYPE<br>
    );
  </code>
  <p>
    In this second example, a constraint is applied after all of the columns
    have been declared.
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE table_name (<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column1, DATA TYPE,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column2, DATA TYPE,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column3, DATA TYPE,<br>
    CONSTRAINT contraint_name CONTRAINT TYPE (column_name)<br>
    );
  </code>
  <p>
    An example of a table we created in class using this code is shown below. In
    this example, the constraint <code>NOT NULL</code> is added in-line to the
    <strong>customer_id</strong> column and the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>
    constraint is added at the end to the same column. The name of the <code>
    PRIMARY KEY</code> constraint is given as <strong>pk_customer_id</strong>.
  </p>
  <code>
    CREATE TABLE customer (<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_name VARCHAR(55),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_name VARCHAR(55),<br>
    CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)<br>
    );
  </code>

  <h3>2.2 Normalisation</h3>
  <p>
    Database normalisation is a key aspect of creating a relational database. It
    is the process of a designing a database so that each independent piece of
    information only occurs once in the database (except for the forgeign keys
    linking the tables). Each table therefore contains data on one specific
    topic only, minimising duplicate data, avoiding data modifcation issues and
    helping to simplify queries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding normalisation is harder than it appears at first. Although the
    basic idea is easy to get to grips with, when you try to do it yourself you
    end up (or I did at least) wondering how far to split different columns into
    new tables and how many to group together. The degree of normalisation that
    you go for should fit into one of the several different types of
    normalisation technique. Each one of these has a set of rules that defines
    it. We were given a homework task of reading about these different types.
  </p>
  <p>
    The different normalisation techniques are called database normal forms. The
    following is a list of the different ones that are used:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1NF (First Normal Form)</li>
    <li>2NF (Second Normal Form)</li>
    <li>3NF (Third Normal Form)</li>
    <li>BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)</li>
    <li>4NF (Fourth Normal Form)</li>
    <li>5NF (Fifth Normal Form)</li>
    <li>6NF (Sixth Normal Form)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The first normal form is the least normalised of the forms while the sixth
    is the most normalised. The theory of database normalisation in SQL is still
    being developed. However, for most purposes you would only need to normalise
    to the third normal form. I will briefly cover the first three forms here.
  </p>

  <h4>1NF</h4>
  <p>
    This has the smallest degree of normalisation. There are only two rules for
    1NF:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each table cell should contain a single value.</li>
    <li>Each record (i.e. row) needs to be unique.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In 1NF, the primary key can be a compound key, i.e. it can comprise of two
    columns. For example, you might have two people with the same name in the
    table who live at two different addresses. To uniquely identify a record in
    this situation, you wouldn't be able to use only their name, you would
    require their address as well.

  <h4>2NF</h4>
  <p>
    2NF is the same as 1NF except the primary key must be a single column. This
    is usually done by using an id column. The rules for 2NF are therefore:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be in 1NF.</li>
    <li>Single column primary key.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3NF</h4>
  <p>
    3NF is apparently what you should aim for with your database. To satisfy the
    third normal form, your database must be in 2NF but must also not contain any
    transistive functional dependencies. These are when values in one column of
    a table are dependent on a value in another column of the same table. There
    was an example of this in my project. I had a table containing information
    about different cabins that people could book to stay in on a holiday
    retreat. The table contained information about whether the cabin had a hot
    tub, the cabin capacity and what type of view there was from the cabin.
    However, it also had a column containing nightly rates but these depended on
    the contents of the other columns. For example, if a cabin got a hot tub
    then the nightly rate would increase. Therefore I moved the nightly rates
    into a different table. The rules for 3NF are therefore:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be in 2NF.</li>
    <li>Have no transistive functional dependencies.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>3. Data modification techniques</h2>
  <p>
    The last section of this lesson covered the different categories of SQL
    commands and how you can use some of the commands to modify the data and the
    database.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Definition Language (DDL)</h3>
  <p>
    DDL consists of SQL statements that are used to create and modify the
    structure of a database, its objects and tables. The following table lists
    some of the core DDL commands and what they do.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>DDL command</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CREATE</code></td>
      <td>Used to create a database or its objects (e.g. tables, functions).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ALTER</code></td>
      <td>
        Used to change an existing object, e.g. change column data type, add/
        remove column, change column constraints.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DROP</code></td>
      <td>
        Remove objects and data from the database. Will respond with an error if
        you try to drop a column that is a foreign key. Be careful with this
        one!
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>RENAME</code></td>
      <td>Rename an existing object in the database.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h3>
  <p>
    DML commands handle the manipulation of data and are the most commonly
    used commands. We have seen most of these already:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>DML command</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SELECT</code></td>
      <td>
        Can also be considered part of Data Query Language (DQL). Used to
        retrieve data from the database.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>INSERT</code></td>
      <td>Inserts data into a table.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>UPDATE</code></td>
      <td>
        Used to modify columns in a single table. Used with the <code>SET</code>
        keyword and the <code>WHERE</code> clause.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DELETE</code></td>
      <td>
        Deletes one or more rows in a table. It is permanent so be careful. Use
        the <code>WHERE</code> clause!
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

</body>
