  <h2>1. Backup and restore</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Using MySQL from the command line</h3>
  <p>
    Backing up a database is done from the command line (also known as the
    shell). Before learning how to back up a database, it is a good idea to
    become familiar with using this. As a note for myself, it is worth
    mentioning that the Learning SQL book (Beaulieu, 2020) that I am reading
    alongside the course contains MySQL examples that are all run from the
    command line rather than from the workbench.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of this information here is relevant for a Mac. The command line is
    accessed by the Terminal application:
  </p>

  on a Mac.">
  <p>
    To run MySQL in the terminal, you need to get the terminal to run this file:
  </p>
  <code>/usr/local/mysql-8.0.20-macos10.15-x86_64/bin/mysql</code>
  <p>
    The path shown above is just where it is on my computer, it might be
    different for someone else. It is also worth noting that an alias has been
    placed in the local folder so that you can just use the following path which
    removes that awkwardly named folder in the middle:
  </p>
  <code>/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql</code>
  <p>
    Because you have a user name and password to access the server, just running
    that path from the command line won't work as it will be trying to access a
    file that is protected. You need to add a bit more on to the end of the path
    as shown here:
  </p>
  <code>/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p</code>
  <p>
    The username here is <strong>root</strong> but you would just put whatever
    your username is in here. When you press enter and run this code, the
    command line will request your password. When I type mine in it doesn't look
    like it's doing anything at all. But typing the password then pressing enter
    does the job. This is what the terminal window should look like once this
    has all been done correctly:
  </p>
  <img src="../images/mysql-command-line.png" alt="Screenshot of the terminal
  showing the mysql> prompt, which indicates MySQL is ready to work.">
  <p>
    Once the above is complete, MySQL will be running in the command line and
    you can type queries out just as you would in the workbench. As you only
    have the command line and no nice user interface, there are a few statements
    that are particularly useful.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Statement</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SHOW DATABASES;</code></td>
      <td>Lists all the databases on the server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SHOW FULL TABLES;</code></td>
      <td>
        Shows a list of the tables present in the current database (after you
        have told it which database to use with <code>USE database_name;</code>).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>DESC table_name;</code></td>
      <td>Shows a list of the columns in the table.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SELECT database();</code></td>
      <td>This tells you which database is currently in use.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Once you are done with using MySQL, you can tell it close by typing <code>
    exit</code>. The next line that comes up will be the normal command line,
    rather than a <code>mysql></code> prompt.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bin folder contains lots of other files related to MySQL that you might
    want to use at some point during your session, including the file that is
    used to create a backup in the following section. It might be easier to
    change the current working directory in the command line to that folder when
    you first start in the command line so that you aren't having to type out
    long paths. To do this, use the following code where <code>cd</code> just
    means <em>change directory</em>. You would then use the second line of code
    shown below to run MySQL, after which it will ask you for your password. For
    some reason that I did look into but don't want to bother myself with at the
    moment, you must include the <code>./</code> at the start of the second line
    to indicate that the file is in the current directory. Leaving it out just
    doesn't work.
  </p>
  <code>
    cd /usr/local/mysql/bin<br>
    ./mysql -u root -p
  </code>
  <p>
    <code>usr</code> is a hidden folder so it might not be easy to find straight
    away. To quickly toggle show/hide hidden files/folders in file explorer
    (should you be wanting to check this is where your MySQL files actually are)
    press <code>SHIFT + CMD + .</code> at the same time.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Creating a backup</h3>
  <p>
    Now that we know how to use the command line, we can easily create a backup.
    All we do is run the <code>mysqldump</code> file from the command line and
    provide it with a bit of extra information. This can be done with the code
    shown below.
  </p>
  <code>
    /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump -u root -p database_name &gt/usr/local/mysql/
    backups/database_nameBackup
  </code>
  <p>
    The first part of this is the path to the <code>mysqldump</code> file. If
    you have changed the working directory then you would just provide the
    appropriate path to the <code>mysqldump</code> file from your current
    directory. You then provide the username and password (in this case you are
    asked for the password after you have run this line of code). You then need
    to tell it which database you are wanting to back up. The final part of this
    code is a path to the directory where you want to save the backup. I had
    created a folder in the mysql folder called backups so that I have one place
    to keep them all together but you could save it anywhere.
  </p>

  <h3>1.3 Restoring from a backup</h3>
  <p>
    It is good to test your backup by restoring it on a test server or another
    machine. The restore is done from the original <code>mysql</code> file we
    used in section 1.1 above. I didn't want to mess around with creating a test
    server as I don't know how to do this. So I changed the bakery database that
    we have been using in class by adding in a couple of new entries into the
    savoury table and then tried to restore it to the backup I made before the
    changes in order to check that the backup and restore had worked. Happily
    it did work! The code I used is shown below:
  </p>
  <code>
    cd /usr/local/mysql/bin<br>
    ./mysql -u root -p bakery &lt;../backups/bakeryBackup
  </code>
  <p>
    It would also work with the following if you haven't changed the current
    directory:
  </p>
  <code>
    /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p bakery &lt;/usr/local/mysql/backups/
    bakeryBackup
  </code>


  <h2>2. Data import and export</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Data import</h3>
  <p>
    We didn't cover reading data into SQL (e.g. from a csv file) in this week's
    lesson. It does, however, mention we should be doing this on one of the
    slides. So I have looked up some resources online to find out how to do
    this. There seems to be a way to do it with some code from the command line
    or a more user-friendly way with the MySQL workbench.
  </p>
  <h4>Code</h4>
  <p>
    I had a go at this during my course project. I obtained some customer
    details data from an online data generator and wanted to import this data
    into my database from csv files. In order to do this you need to make sure
    that you have created a table with the same columns as the csv. I tried to
    import addresses into my customer_addresses using the following code:
  </p>
  <code>
    LOAD DATA INFILE '/usr/local/mysql/im-ex-files/addresses.csv'<br>
    INTO TABLE customer_addresses<br>
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','<br>
    ENCLOSED BY '"'<br>
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'<br>
    IGNORE 1 ROWS;
  </code>
  <p>
    However, I kept getting the following error:
  </p>
  <code>
    Error Code: 1290. The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv
    option so it cannot execute this statement
  </code>
  <p>
    I looked into this and it seems to be in place for database security. You
    can only import data into the database from a specified directory that would
    have been set up when you install MySQL. However, when I check where this
    directory is (using <code>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";</code>)
    there doesn't seem to be one set up. I did look into how I could set this up
    but it became too time consuming so I gave up on this for now and decided to
    just use the workbench import wizard for my project this time.
  </p>
  <h4>Workbench</h4>
  <p>
    In the workbench, if you right click on the table you want to populate with
    data, you will see an option to open the <strong>Table data import wizard
    </strong>. You can just follow the steps through this to import the data
    easily. You will need to make sure you select the right options such as the
    delimiter that matched the one in your csv file.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Data export</h3>
  <p>
    After the fiasco of trying to import data using code, I didn't bother trying
    to export using code. You can export a table or view easily in the workbench
    as a csv file from the section of the workbench circled in pink on the image
    below.

  workbench showing the section of the workbench where there is an option to
  export data as a csv file.">
